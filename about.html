    An e-commerce company is a business that sells products or services through the internet, enabling customers to make purchases online via websites or mobile applications. These companies offer a wide range of goods, from physical items like electronics, clothing, and home goods, to digital products like software, books, and music. E-commerce companies provide a convenient shopping experience, allowing customers to browse, compare prices, read reviews, and make secure payments from anywhere in the world. After a purchase is made, the company handles the order fulfillment process, including shipping or delivering the product, and often offers customer support for returns or inquiries. With the growth of online shopping, e-commerce businesses have become an integral part of the global economy, providing efficient and accessible solutions for both businesses and consumers.
